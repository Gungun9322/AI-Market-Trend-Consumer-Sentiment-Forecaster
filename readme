Step 1: Data Cleaning (cleaning.py)
Raw review data is cleaned to improve data quality by removing duplicates, handling missing values, and standardizing data formats for accurate analysis.

Step 2: Data Merging
Cleaned datasets from Amazon and Flipkart are merged into a single dataset to enable unified and cross-platform consumer analysis.

Step 3: Data Reduction
After merging, the dataset becomes very large. To improve performance and efficiency, unnecessary columns and records are removed while preserving important information.

Step 4: Category Definition (category.py)
Products are classified into predefined categories, which helps in analyzing category-wise demand, trends, and sentiment patterns.

Step 5: Sentiment Analysis (sentiment.py)
Sentiment analysis is applied to classify customer reviews as Positive, Negative, or Neutral. Randomized dates are also assigned to support time-based trend analysis.

Step 6: Topic Modeling
Topic modeling techniques are used to extract key themes and discussion topics from customer reviews, helping identify common issues, preferences, and emerging trends.

Step 7: External Data Collection (APIs)
Additional data is collected to enrich insights:

news_api.py collects news articles related to products and market trends and analyzes their sentiment.

reddit.py extracts Reddit discussions to capture real-world consumer opinions and trending topics.

rapid.py fetches supplementary real-time data using RapidAPI services.

Step 8: Dashboard Generation
All processed data is integrated into an interactive dashboard to visualize market trends, consumer sentiment, category performance, and cross-platform insights.
